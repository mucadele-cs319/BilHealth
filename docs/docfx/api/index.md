# BilHealth API Docs

Here you can find the documentation for our backend project implemented with ASP.NET Core.

> **Note:** DocFX v2.x does not support C# 9, meaning that `record` types (previously used as our DTOs)
> are unfortunately not possible to generate documentation for.
> As such, our DTOs have gone back to regular classes.
